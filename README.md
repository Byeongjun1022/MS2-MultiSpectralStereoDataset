- 2023.03.30: Open Github page.
- TBA: The datset will be be released in April. 

## $MS^2$ Dataset Specification
### Sensor System
We designed a data collection platform that consists of RGB, NIR, thermal, and LiDAR stereo system along with a GPS/IMU module.

### Dataset Example
The collected dataset are taken under locations of campus, city, residential area, road, and suburban with various time slots (morning, day, and night) and weather conditions (clear-sky, cloudy, and rainy). According to the surrounding conditions, each spectrum sensor shows different
aspects, advantages, and disadvantages induced by their sensor characteristics.
